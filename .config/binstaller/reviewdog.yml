# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binary-install/binstaller/main/schema/InstallSpec.json
# TODO: Generate install.sh from GitHub Actions and support gh attestation.
# https://github.com/binary-install/binstaller is still WIP but it should be ok
# since it's built and maintained by me (haya14busa, a maintainer of reviewdog).
# The installer script works fine and fixed bugs which existed in the previous
# script generated by godownloader. Example: The previous script didn't work if
# release artifacts contains <binary-asset>.sbom.json since the prev script
# just used grep with <binary-asset> without '$'.
